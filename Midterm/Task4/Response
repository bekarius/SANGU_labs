Real-Life Application of Diffie-Hellman:
Diffie-Hellman key exchange is widely used in real-world applications such as TLS handshakes (e.g., HTTPS websites) and secure messaging apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram.
During a TLS handshake, for instance, the server and client use Diffie-Hellman (often elliptic curve-based, like ECDHE) to securely agree on a shared session key—even over an untrusted internet connection.
Similarly, secure messaging protocols use it to establish ephemeral session keys for every conversation.

Diffie-Hellman is crucial for secure communication because it allows two parties to derive a shared secret key without transmitting it directly.
This protects the key from interception and enables forward secrecy—meaning even if an attacker compromises long-term keys later, they cannot decrypt past communications.
