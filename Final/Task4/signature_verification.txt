Signature Verification Explanation
==================================

When Bob decrypts `signed_message.asc` using GPG, the tool automatically checks for a digital signature. In this case, the output confirms:

    gpg: Good signature from "Alice <alice@sangu.ge>"

This proves two things:
- The message was created and signed using Alice’s private key, verifying her identity.
- The message has not been modified in transit. Any tampering would result in a failed or bad signature.

If Alice’s public key is not imported, the signature cannot be validated. If the file is altered, GPG will report a "BAD signature" warning.

Digital signatures thus ensure both authenticity and integrity for secure email communications.
