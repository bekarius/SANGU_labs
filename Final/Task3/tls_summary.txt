TLS Communication Inspection - OpenSSL s_client
===============================================

OpenSSL connection was established to www.google.com:443. The following details were extracted:

1. Certificate Chain:
   - Root CA: GTS Root R4 (Google Trust Services LLC)
   - Intermediate CA: WE2 (Google Trust Services)
   - Leaf Certificate: www.google.com

2. Cipher Suite Used:
   - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

3. TLS Version:
   - TLSv1.3

These details confirm that the connection uses a modern, secure cipher suite and a trusted certificate authority chain.


Wireshark TLS Handshake Analysis
--------------------------------

The attached screenshot shows a TLS handshake captured on TCP port 443.

- **Client Hello:** The first visible TLSv1.3 packet from 10.0.4.33 to the server (port 443) marks the start of the handshake. The client proposes supported TLS versions, cipher suites, and provides its key share for the key exchange.
- **Server Certificate:** The server replies (shortly after Client Hello) with its own TLSv1.3 packet, which contains both the Server Hello (negotiation) and its digital certificate for authentication.
- **Key Exchange:** In TLS 1.3, the key exchange parameters are included within both the Client Hello and Server Hello messages. These are used by both parties to derive the symmetric session keys.
- **Encrypted Application Data:** After the handshake is complete, all following packets are labeled as Application Data and are encrypted.


TLS provides confidentiality by encrypting all data exchanged between client and server using strong symmetric encryption algorithms (such as AES). This ensures that even if the network traffic is intercepted, the contents remain private and unreadable to unauthorized parties.

TLS ensures integrity by including cryptographic checks (like MAC or AEAD) that detect any alteration of the transmitted data. If a message is tampered with, TLS will detect the modification and reject the data.

Additionally, TLS uses digital certificates to authenticate servers, helping prevent impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks.
