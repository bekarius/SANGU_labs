TLS Handshake Process Explained:

1. ClientHello:
   The client begins by sending a "hello" message indicating supported cipher suites and TLS versions.

2. ServerHello and Certificate:
   Server selects the cipher suite and sends its public certificate signed by a trusted CA, proving its identity.

3. Key Exchange:
   Client and server securely exchange keys (using RSA, Diffie-Hellman, or ECC), creating a shared symmetric encryption key.

4. Handshake Completion:
   After key agreement, both confirm encryption is ready, establishing a secure, encrypted session.

Protection Against MITM Attacks in TLS:

- Certificate Authority (CA) Validation:
  Trusted third-party CA certificates verify server authenticity.

- Certificate Verification:
  Browser checks certificate validity against trusted CA lists. A mismatch or invalid certificate alerts the user, blocking potential MITM attackers.

- Secure Key Exchange:
  Asymmetric cryptography securely exchanges session keys. Without access to private keys, attackers can't decrypt data.

Application of TLS in HTTPS Websites:

- HTTPS uses TLS for secure browser-server communication.
- Protects sensitive data (user logins, financial details) against interception or modification.
- Ensures data integrity, authenticity, and privacy during web transactions.
