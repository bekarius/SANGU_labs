RSA vs AES Encryption:

Performance:
- RSA encryption and decryption are computationally intensive and slower.
- AES is optimized for speed and suitable for encrypting large data volumes quickly.

Use-cases:
- RSA is ideal for securely exchanging small data (e.g., AES keys, passwords) and digital signatures.
- AES is commonly used for efficiently encrypting files, databases, and large datasets.

Real-world scenarios combine RSA (for secure key exchange) with AES (for bulk data encryption).
